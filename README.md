# Claude Pace

A lightweight Claude Code status line and rate limit tracker that shows your 5-hour and 7-day quota usage in real time. Pure Bash + jq, single file, zero npm.

If you are searching for a Claude Code statusline, a Claude Code quota monitor, or a Claude Code usage tracker, claude-pace is built for that narrow job. It shows not only how much quota you have used, but whether your current burn rate is sustainable before the window resets.

## TL;DR

- Claude Code status line with `5h` and `7d` quota usage, reset countdowns, and pace delta
- Pace-aware rate limit tracking, `⇡15%` means overspending, `⇣15%` means headroom
- Pure Bash + jq, single file, no Node.js runtime and no lockfile churn
- Install as a Claude Code plugin, with `npx`, or as a single script

Most statuslines show "you used 60%." That number means nothing without context. 60% with 30 minutes left? Fine, the window resets soon. 60% with 4 hours left? You are about to hit the wall. claude-pace compares your burn rate to the time remaining and shows the delta.

- **⇣15%** green = you've used 15% less than expected. Headroom. Keep going.
- **⇡15%** red = you're burning 15% faster than sustainable. Slow down.
- **15%** / **20%** = used in the 5h and 7d windows. **3h** = resets in 3 hours.
- Top line: model, effort, project `(branch)`, `3f +24 -7` = git diff stats

Claude Code supports custom status lines through its `statusLine` setting and `/statusline` workflow in the official docs:

## How Claude Pace Tracks Quota

Claude Code polls the statusline every ~300ms:

| Data | Source | Cache |
|------|--------|-------|
| Model, context, cost | stdin JSON (single `jq` call) | None needed |
| Quota (5h, 7d, pace) | stdin `rate_limits` (live, no fallback) | None |
| Git branch + diff | `git` commands | Private cache dir, 5s TTL |

Requires Claude Code `2.1.80+`, where `rate_limits` is available in statusline stdin. When stdin omits `rate_limits` (older Claude Code, or providers that do not surface the field), claude-pace shows `--` for 5h/7d quota and the session cost if available. No cached or stale quota is ever shown, because a cached account-level snapshot cannot be proven to belong to the current provider/account.

Git cache files live in a private per-user directory (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/claude-pace` or `~/.cache/claude-pace`, mode 700). All cache reads are validated before use. No files are ever written to shared `/tmp`.

## Claude Code Statusline FAQ

**Does it need Node.js?**
No. Only `jq` (available via `brew install jq` or your package manager). No npm, no node_modules, no lock files.

**How does pace tracking work?**
claude-pace compares your current usage percentage to the fraction of time elapsed in each window (5-hour and 7-day). If you've used 40% of your quota but only 30% of the time has passed, the pace delta shows ⇡10% (red, burning too fast). If you've used 30% with 40% of time elapsed, it shows ⇣10% (green, headroom).

**Does it make network calls?**
No. Quota data comes from stdin `rate_limits` on Claude Code `2.1.80+`. If `rate_limits` is absent (older Claude Code, or providers that omit it), claude-pace shows `--` for 5h/7d and the local session cost when present. No stale quota fallback — see [the removal decision](docs/decisions/2026-05-20-quota-cache-removal.md).

**Can I inspect the source?**
The entire tool is [one Bash file](claude-pace.sh). Read it before you install it.
